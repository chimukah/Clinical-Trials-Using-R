# Intention-To-Treat (ITT) vs. Per-Protocol (PP) 
* Quoted from https://www.clinfo.eu/itt-vs-pp/
## The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) principle
* The intention-to-treat principle defines that every patient randomized to the clinical study should enter the primary analysis. Accordingly, patients who drop out prematurely, are non-compliant to the study treatment, or even take the wrong study treatment, are included in the primary analysis within the respective treatment group they have been assigned to at randomization (“as randomized”).
* Consequently, in an analysis according to the ITT principle, the original randomization and the number of patients in the treatment groups remain unchanged, the analysis population is as complete as possible, and a potential bias due to exclusion of patients is avoided. Thus, the patient set used for the primary analysis according to the ITT principle is called “full analysis set”.
## The Per-Protocol (PP) principle
* While an analysis according to the ITT principle aims to preserve the original randomization and to avoid potential bias due to exclusion of patients, the aim of a per-protocol (PP) analysis is to identify a treatment effect which would occur under optimal conditions; i.e. to answer the question: what is the effect if patients are fully compliant? Therefore, some patients (from the full analysis set) need to be excluded from the population used for the PP analysis (PP population).
* There might be further criteria for selecting a PP population; however, the following approaches are essential:
   * The assignment to the PP analysis set needs to take place prior to the analysis (if possible in a blinded manner).
   * Deviations that might be affected by the actual treatment should not be used as exclusion criteria: e.g., “premature discontinuation from the study” might not be a good choice of criterion for exclusion from the PP analysis, if this discontinuation was due to lack of efficacy (and therefore associated with the treatment received).
