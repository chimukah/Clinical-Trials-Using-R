Q1: Find the sample size necessary to detect a difference in mean response of 50 units between two treatments with 85% power using a t-test (one-sided) at the 0.05 level of significance. Assume the population standard deviation = 75. Whatâ€™s the relationship between sample size and power? 
Q2: Suppose there are two treatments, and treatment 1 is the traditional treatment with mortality rate 0.25, and a new treatment is treatment 2 and can reduce the even rate to 0.15. If we are to conduct a clinical trial where equal allocation to either the treatment 1 or treatment 2. How large a sample size is necessary to detect a clinically important difference with 80% power using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance?
