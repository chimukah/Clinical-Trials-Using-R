* 1: The clinicians design one trial: there are 2 treatments and 2 prognostic factors (gender, race). Gender will contain female and male classes. Race includes African, White, Asian classes. Please design the treatment assignments for 300 subjects. (Please use Permuted blocked randomization method, and the block size will be a random number). Answer the following question:
    
   * i. How many subjects are assigned to different Treatments?  This question will be same as how many subjects are recruited in each treatment.
   * ii. How many subjects are assigned in each treatment within different strata? You may consider a table to list the treatment assignments of individuals within each stratum.

* 2: The clinical trial has two treatment, and 1 prognostic factor (gender: female and male).  Please write down your own code to design a treatment assignments for 100 subjects using permuted blocked randomization method. Please also answer the previous two question (i and ii) according to your own randomization procedure. 
* 3. The clinical trial has 3 treatment, and allocation rate among treatments will be 4:1:2. There are one factor age (including 3 classes: age<40 years old;  40< age<50, age >50).  Suppose the clinicians want to recruit 350 patients, and how do they do the treatment assignments.  

   * i: Still use the permuted blocked randomization method, and what’s your results? (I suggest that you could consider another package or function to answer this question.)


   * ii. Applying the minimization randomization method to this trial, what’s your results?
